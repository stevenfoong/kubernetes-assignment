# Kubernetes Assignment
This is a documentation for one of my interview technical assignment.

## Prepare the workstation.

### Install ansible and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) module
```
sudo dnf install ansible -y
pip install requests google-auth
```

To work with the GCP modules, youâ€™ll first need to get some credentials in the JSON format:
1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
2. [Grant access](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access)
3. [Download JSON credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys)

### Enable GCE Dynamic Inventory
First, [Enable **Compute Engine API** at the GCP for the project](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api)

To be able to use this GCE dynamic inventory plugin, you need to enable it first by specifying the following in the `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file:
```
[inventory]
enable_plugins = gcp_compute
```
Create the inventory.gcp.yml with the following content
```
plugin: gcp_compute
projects:
  - <gcp-project-id>
auth_kind: serviceaccount
service_account_file: ansible.json
```
Executing `ansible-inventory --list -i inventory.gcp.yml` will create a list of GCP instances that are ready to be configured using Ansible.

#### Initial kurbenetes
Issue the following command to initial the cluster . Replace the env parameter as needed.
```
ansible-playbook initial-cluster.yml -e "env=test"
```
